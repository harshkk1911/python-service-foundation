# Python Service Foundation

This repository is a structured learning project focused on building strong
Python engineering and backend foundations.

The goal of this repository is not just to write code, but to develop
clear problem-solving skills, clean project structure, and professional
engineering habits.

## Goals
- Build clean, modular Python code
- Practice problem-solving with a brute-force → optimized approach
- Learn when and why to use common techniques (hashing, pointers, etc.)
- Create a strong foundation for backend development
